## Architecture Overview

This project implements a traditional client-side web architecture. It is a static landing page built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements and dynamic content. There is no server-side component; all rendering and logic occur directly in the user's web browser. The JavaScript functionality heavily relies on jQuery and a collection of third-party plugins to achieve various UI/UX enhancements.
